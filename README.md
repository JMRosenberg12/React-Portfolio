#React-Portfolio

This project is the updated version of my Portfolio. This time, with React! 



All you have to do is...

Step 1: Create a react app.

Step 2: Npm start and use /localhost:3000 to veiw while editing.

Step 3: Keep editing and commit until you got the app working right.

Step 4: Deploy to heroku! Make sure your app is not inside the folder with the app name you made because otherwise, the push will fail.
